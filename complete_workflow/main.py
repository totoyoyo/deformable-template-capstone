"""
Should be list of dictionaries
"""
results = None
"""
Dictionary should contain (name, alphas, sd2, Gamma inv)
"""

""" Could be a dataframe?"""
"""row: name alphas, sd2, gamma_inv"""


### do some classification

"""
Now,we have a list of images with labels on them
"""

"""
Classification should take a list of dictionaries and
a list of images (without the labels)
"""

"""
return a list of labels for the images, and a list of likelihoods for all classes
ie each image should have a list of likelihoods
"""


### do evaluation

"""
Given list of labels and likelihoods
