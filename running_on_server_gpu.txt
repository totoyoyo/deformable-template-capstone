How to run the file on the server:
	1. put files in home/peeranat/project
	2. Note: make sure to use os.path.dirname(full_path) when saving or loading
		Ex. print(os.path.dirname(full_path) + "/myfile_two.txt")
	
	3. the name of the folder on the GPU node is /raw_data_peeranat/


Use the command:
	srun -u --partition=colleague --nodelist=20-196  python3.6 /raw_data_peeranat/.....
	
	
For sbatch

sample sbatch:
-------
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --nodelist=20-196
#SBATCH --job-name=toto_capstone
#SBATCH --partition=colleague
#SBATCH --qos=colleague
#SBATCH --mail-type=end

srun -u python3.6 /raw_data_peeranat/for_running/file_writing_show_path.py
-----

run this with "sbatch ./project/......sh"


Speedtests:

GPU: same as pc
CPU: slow by default! (for my computer its 62 sec)

For 10 threads all (optimal):
    alpha update speed:
    42 sec, 49 sec, 43 sec

    gamma update speed (100x100 3 images)
    163 sec


For 20 threads all:
    alpha update speed:
    65 sec

    gamma update speed (100x100 3 images)
    163 sec

For 6 threads all:
    alpha update speed:
    51 sec

    gamma update speed (100x100 3 images)
     sec

For 8 threads all:
    alpha update speed:
    46 sec

    gamma update speed (100x100 3 images)
     sec
	 
For 12 threads all:
    alpha update speed:
    48 sec

    gamma update speed (100x100 3 images)
     sec
