use pseudo inverse to correct instability


sigma goes to zero if the kernels are many and small


Gaussian on every pixel
For scipy:
inv takes 300 seconds to do twice on SigmaG
pinv takes 1328 seconds ..
pinv2 takes 569.45 sec
pinvh takes 722 sec for pinvh
pinv numpy takes 1183 sec (non hermitian)
	hermitian takes 240 sec

Summary, pinv numpy is best!


Look up condition number

Float32 and float64 yielded very different results
